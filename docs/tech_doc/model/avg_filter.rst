Recursive Average Filter
========================

The Recursive Average Filter is a simple yet effective technique used in signal processing and time series analysis to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends or cycles. It works by averaging the current data point with the previous average, thereby creating a smoothed version of the original signal.
