Low Pass Filter
================

The Low Pass Filter is a fundamental tool in signal processing used to remove high-frequency noise from a signal while preserving the low-frequency components. The filter is based on a recursive algorithm that continuously updates the filtered value based on the current input and the previous filtered value.
